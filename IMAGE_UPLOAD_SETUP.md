# üì∏ Image Upload Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ **Image Upload System Implemented**

I've added comprehensive image upload functionality throughout your admin panel! Here's what's been implemented:

### **üñºÔ∏è Image Upload Features**

1. **‚úÖ ImageUpload Component** (`/src/components/ImageUpload.tsx`)
   - **Drag & drop** functionality
   - **Click to upload** from local files
   - **Image preview** before upload
   - **File validation** (type and size)
   - **Professional UI** with loading states

2. **‚úÖ Upload Utilities** (`/src/utils/imageUpload.ts`)
   - **Supabase Storage** integration
   - **Cloudinary** fallback option
   - **Base64** conversion for small images
   - **Error handling** and validation

3. **‚úÖ Admin Panel Integration**

## üöÄ **Setup Supabase Storage**

### **Step 1: Enable Storage in Supabase**

1. **Go to** [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Select** your project
3. **Navigate** to **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. **Click** "Create a new bucket"

### **Step 2: Create Storage Buckets**

Create these buckets in Supabase Storage:

#### **Product Images Bucket**
- **Name**: `product-images`
- **Public**: ‚úÖ Yes (so images can be accessed publicly)
- **File size limit**: 5MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*`

#### **Category Images Bucket**
- **Name**: `category-images`
- **Public**: ‚úÖ Yes
- **File size limit**: 5MB
- **Allowed MIME types**: `image/*`

### **Step 3: Set Storage Policies**

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor to set up storage policies:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on storage.objects
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy for product images - allow public read, authenticated write
CREATE POLICY "Public can view product images" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload product images" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'product-images' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update product images" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'product-images' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete product images" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'product-images' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

-- Policy for category images - allow public read, authenticated write
CREATE POLICY "Public can view category images" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'category-images');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload category images" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'category-images' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update category images" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'category-images' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete category images" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'category-images' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );
```
